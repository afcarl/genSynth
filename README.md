========

An evolutionary art platform for evolving new synthetic musical instruments.
Branch of a showcased instrument below or evolve your own!

### Install Instructions
 - Install [MongoDB](http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-ubuntu/) (Currently using 2.6.5)
 - Install Node, global bower, global grunt-cli, and global ember-cli 0.0.46
 - Update Config Keys
   - /app/app/index.html AddThis pub-ID && Google Analytics Id
   - /app/config/providers
   - /app/config/environment.js contentSecurityPolicy connect-src
   - /server/server/config/env/production dev & test
 - `ember init` in /app (saying no to replacing any files). This should install all npm and bower dependencies.
 - `sudo npm install` in the server folder

 Running the ember app separately
 - `ember server` in /app and `grunt dev` in /server

 Running both app and server together
 - `./build.sh` in the /app folder to build the application and copy it to the server/appDist/ folder
 - Run `grunt devfull` or `grunt prod` in /server. Or manually start the `server.js` and `app-server.js` scripts in node.

Notes for running with PM2
 - after building, run `sudo NODE_ENV=production pm2 start server.js` and `sudo NODE_ENV=production pm2 start app-server.js`
 - If you have issues binding on port 80, use `sudo setcap 'cap_net_bind_service=+ep' /usr/bin/nodejs` or `sudo setcap 'cap_net_bind_service=+ep' /usr/bin/node` depending
   on where the non symlinked version of node is
